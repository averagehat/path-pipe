Sequencing data were analyzed using a rapid computa-
tional pipeline developed by the DeRisi Laboratory to 
classify MDS reads and identify potential pathogens by 
comparison to the entire NCBI nucleotide reference 
database [6]. The pipeline consists of the following steps.

STAR (v2.5.1b) with:  hg38, (panTro4, 2011, UCSC)
-- drop unaligned reads


PriceSeqFilter [11] with the “-rnf 90” and “-rqf 85 0.98” settings.

duplicate removal
 > samtools rmdup


cd-hit-dup (v4.6.1) compress: reads at least 95% identical 
“-rqf 85 0.98” settings. Reads passing quality control

 Paired reads were then assessed for complexity by compression with the Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithm [13]. Read pairs with a compression score <0.45 were subsequently removed.

Bowtie2 (v2.2.4) (very-sensitive-local) with: hg38, panTro4
-- drop all except Read pairs in which both members remained unmapped 
GSNAPL (v2015-12-31) 
 -- NCBI NT (downloaded July 2015, indexed with k = 16mers), and preprocessed to remove known repetitive sequences with RepeatMasker (vOpen-4.0) (www.repeatmasker.org).

Rapsearch2:  NCBI non-redundant protein database (July 2015) 


-- "preprocessed to remove known repetitive sequences with RepeatMasker" -- does this apply to nt/nr database? 
-- NT was in some way de-duped
