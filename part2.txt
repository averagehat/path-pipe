drop all reads with compression score < 0.45

http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~gusfield/cs224f09/lznotes.pdf

The compression score, calculated as the difference in bytes between the original sequence and the compressed version, is inversely proportional to complexity

For example, the P. falciparum genome contains a large number of low-complexity sequence elements as a result of a high frequency of continuous stretches of A and T nucleotides in both the non-coding and the coding regions. ArrayOligoSelector automatically detects such sequences by subjecting candidate oligonucleotide sequences to a lossless compression

===== 
bowtie (hostmap 2.0) 

Index:
bowtie2-build panTro4.fa,hg38.fa bowtie-index --threads 16 --large-index [ --seed 12 ] 

Align:
bowtie2 -1 R1.fq -2 R2.fq --very-sensitive-local -x index [ -S outsam (otherwise stdout) ]

-- then drop mapped / pair mapped using samtools

==== 
GSNAPL (w/ RepeatMasker on NT(??)) (or RepeatMasker is run on deduped reads?)
  The gsnapl
  program is equivalent to gmap, and is based on the same source code,
  but is compiled to use 64-bit index files instead of 32-bit files.


Index:
$ mkdir -p gmap-db
$ gmap_build -D gmap-db -d gmap-db -k 16 both.fasta

Map:
gsnap[l] -d gmap-db R1.fq R2.fq -A sam > output.sam
(3rd column is what it mapped to)


RapSearch2

Index:
$ prerapsearch -d nr.fasta -n rapsearch-nr-db

Map:
$ rapsearch -c R1.deduped.fq R2.deduped.fq  -d rapsearch-nr-db -o out.rapsearch
$ rapsearch -q R1.deduped.fq -d rapsearch-nr-db -o out.rapsearch

  paired info: http://www.cs.indiana.edu/pub/techreports/TR709.pdf
  *.m8 file is like -m 8 output passed to blast. TSV with the following fields:
# Fields: Query	Subject	identity	aln-len	mismatch	gap-openings	q.start	q.end	s.start	s.end	log(e-value)	bit-score
rsDB %> \out -> do
  need [ nr_fasta ]
  cmd "prerapsearch" -d nr_fasta -n out

[rsout <.> "m8", rsout <.> "aln" ] &%> \[_, _] -> do
  need [rsDB, ddR1, ddR2] 
  cmd "rapsearch" -q ddR1 -d rsDB -o rsout

Ask michael:

  what about repeatmasker?
  rapsearch with paired reads? I notice the version isn't listed in the paper. only 2.12 seems to support paired-end reads.


have to look up taxonomic information using gi.  where is that code?  https://gist.github.com/averagehat/d6461cb6ec147a5473827352acbf4a8a
 -- different for NT and NR?
