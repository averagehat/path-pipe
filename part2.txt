drop all reads with compression score < 0.45

The compression score, calculated as the difference in bytes between the original sequence and the compressed version, is inversely proportional to complexity

For example, the P. falciparum genome contains a large number of low-complexity sequence elements as a result of a high frequency of continuous stretches of A and T nucleotides in both the non-coding and the coding regions. ArrayOligoSelector automatically detects such sequences by subjecting candidate oligonucleotide sequences to a lossless compression

===== 
bowtie (hostmap 2.0) 

Index:
bowtie2-build panTro4.fa,hg38.fa bowtie-index --threads 16 --large-index [ --seed 12 ] 

Align:
bowtie2 -1 R1.fq -2 R2.fq --very-sensitive-local -x index [ -S outsam (otherwise stdout) ]

-- then drop mapped / pair mapped using samtools
